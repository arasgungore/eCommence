# eCommence
An e-commerce app built using React for the frontend and Express for the backend. This project is a full-fledged e-commerce website built to sell a variety of items, including clothing, jewelry, watches, electronics, and more.



## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `backend` for the server-side code and `frontend` for the client-side code.


### Backend

The backend is responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and serving data to the frontend.

- **src/controllers/productController.js**: Handles product-related logic, including fetching data from the external API.
- **src/models/Product.js**: Defines the schema for the product data stored in the database.
- **src/routes/productRoutes.js**: Defines the routes for product-related API endpoints.
- **src/app.js**: Initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, and connects to the database.


### Frontend

The frontend is responsible for presenting the user interface and interacting with the backend to display product information.

- **src/components/ProductList.js**: Displays a list of products fetched from the backend.
- **src/components/ProductCard.js**: Represents an individual product card with details like name, description, and price.
- **src/pages/Home.js**: The main landing page that integrates the ProductList component.
- **src/services/apiService.js**: Handles communication with the backend API.
